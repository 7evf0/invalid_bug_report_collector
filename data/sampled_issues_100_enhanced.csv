Sigh, that's bad news (streamsupport currently runs even on Java 10 / 11 with only a single warning - and that is caused by a test, not the library itself).\r\n\r\nIt's especially annoying since absolutely nothing has changed at those critical places in the Android P master until now.\r\n\r\nThere are lot more usages of Unsafe than the few that you mentioned. I surely could get rid of some of them, but unlikely all of them (as this would cripple the functionality especially for parallel use cases).\r\n\r\nI'll have to let sink that in and think about it. Also, seems I need an additional device for Android P testing now ;)\r\n\r\nOne possible approach could be to fork streamsupport a second time (android-retrostreams being the first fork), this time creating a version that is targeted especially at Android that shares no code with the JVM version in those critical areas.\r\nAs I said, I have to think about it. However, nothing will happen during the next two weeks (I'm away on vacation).\r\n\r\nPertaining to DexGuard: that's simply great! May I ask why you've decided to use streamsupport instead of android-retrostreams?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nStefan"", 'Hi Stefan,\r\n\r\nindeed, a quick grep of the codebase shows much more uses of reflection.\r\nI understand that in more recent Android versions, the functionality is delegated to the native implementation whenever possible, maybe this can also be extended for these cases?\r\n\r\nAnyway I can also try to help with this, although it is not super urgent for us right now, as we still have to see what Android P will actually change, the results are all based on the latest developer previews.\r\n\r\nI sticked to the original streamsupport library, because it allowed to translate the API calls quite simply. If there are default & static methods that are possibly translated by different tools (Android studio desugar, retrolambda, DexGuard itself), the translation mechanism would have to adapt to these tools, which are also subject to change (I especially learned not to rely too much on google android tools :-).\r\n\r\nAnyways, very nice project and I hope that we can offer an open-source solution to use the library with the original Java 8 API very soon.\r\n\r\nbtw. it would also be nice if there would be a different way to disable the delegation to the native implementation. Using system properties does not feel right on Android and is difficult to instrument. An additional hard-coded flag would be much simpler, as we can easily change that when instrumenting the code.', 'Hi Thomas,\r\n\r\nworking backwards ...\r\n\r\ndisabling delegation / system property: yeah, that\'s right, it\'s not Android style. I\'ve initially used that approach on Java 8 and simply adopted it when I introduced delegation for Android 7.\r\nWhat do you mean by ""hard-coded flag""? A ""static final"" something that you\'d set by instrumentation? Can you give me an example?\r\n\r\nAs to why you\'ve chosen streamsupport - I see, makes sense. Android tools - same here ;)\r\n\r\nThe places where Unsafe or any other kind of reflection is hard to replace have mostly to do with fork/join (parallel streams).\r\nI\'ve always wondered how important that use case is on Android devices. Do you have any data points (or an opinion) about this?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nStefan', 'Hi Stefan,\r\n\r\nfor the delegation issue, I had something like this in mind:\r\n\r\nstatic boolean DELEGATION_ENABLED_VIA_INSTRUMENTATION = true;\r\nstatic final boolean DELEGATION_ENABLED = getBooleanPropVal(DELEGATION_ENABLED_P, true) && DELEGATION_ENABLED_VIA_INSTRUMENTATION;\r\n\r\nIt is important the the field DELEGATION_ENABLED_VIA_INSTRUMENTATION is not final as otherwise the compiler would inline its value.\r\n\r\nBut after reading the Known_Problems.txt and looking at the relevant source code, I wonder if this is even necessary anymore. From Spliterators.java:\r\n\r\nif (HAS_STREAMS && (DELEGATION_ENABLED || IS_JAVA9) && !hasAndroid7LHMBug(c)) {\r\n      // always use spliterator delegation on Java 9 from 1.5.6 onwards\r\n      // https://sourceforge.net/p/streamsupport/tickets/299/\r\n      return delegatingSpliterator(c);\r\n}\r\n\r\nDoes this mean that delegation is disabled by default for API 24 & 25 for LinkedHashMaps?\r\nProbably the Known_Problems.txt has to be updated as it is mentioned that delegation is enabled by default and has to be disabled on Android 24 & 25 to avoid the bug (or use a slightly modified code).', ""Hi Thomas,\r\n\r\nI've introduced that additional LHM check measure as a precaution for users that don't read (or understand) this note.\r\n\r\nYes, LinkedHashMaps are exempt from Spliterator delegation on API 24/25 even if Spliterator delegation is enabled generally.\r\nHowever this works only insofar as it can be detected at runtime that the Collection views come from a LHM. For example, wrap a LHM in a Collections.UnmodifiableMap and you are screwed. If you want to guard against such cases you either have to disable Spliterator delegation altogether or manually program around this Android 7.x bug.\r\n\r\nThat's what I wanted to express in this note. Obviously, I didn't fully succeed.\r\n\r\nAs for the DELEGATION_ENABLED_VIA_INSTRUMENTATION switch - I have no problems with that as long as it can be package private.\r\n\r\nI've thought about that shortcoming myself but I didn't want to introduce anything in the public API that hasn't its equivalent in the Java 8 API (and that most users wouldn't understand anyways).\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nStefan"", 'Hi Stefan,\r\n\r\nmaybe I was too fast reading the file. After your explanation and reading it again it is clear to me now and it does not need any further change imho.\r\n\r\nFor the additional field: it can even be private, just not final. So far we do not yet try to disable delegation but it might be interesting for some users that want a fool-proof method to avoid known bugs without changing their code. Actually I never tried to set a system property in an Android application, but it might work as well, as long as it is done before any streamsupport class is accessed. I should create a separate issue explaining the use-case, but it would only be for convenience.', 'Yeah, the ""not final"" bit is clear :)\r\n\r\nYou are right, setting the system property works on Android as you say. That\'s how I\'m doing it in my Android tests.\r\n\r\nWhat I don\'t quite understand is why you want to disable Spliterator delegation at all. If you disable it and use a Collection that employs one of my ""native specializations"" you run into even more risks the newer the Android version happens to be.\r\nThat was one of the main reasons why I\'ve introduced delegation on Android in the first place.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this one helps to understand the history: https://github.com/streamsupport/streamsupport/pull/7\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nStefan\r\n\r\nAddendum: Btw, https://sourceforge.net/p/streamsupport/tickets/240/ was the way that LHM bug was detected. Google didn\'t have tests for that at that time, but I did.', 'Hi Stefan,\r\n\r\nmaybe my reasoning is flawed, but my idea was to provide users with a consistent behavior on all supported Android versions. By default, delegation would be enabled, but they can use a flag to indicate that they want a ""compatibility mode"", which uses a possibly slower method but it will be correct on all versions, thus hotfixing bugs in existing Android versions.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if the reasoning makes sense to you, so far I did not see that disabling delegation would have a major drawback especially on newer Android systems (it would probably be slower, but that would be acceptable).', 'Hi Thomas,\r\n\r\nI believe that\'s a misunderstanding of what disabling Spliterator delegation is doing.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, (obviously) the Spliterator delegation flag only has an effect on API 24 and above.\r\nPrior to that (API 23 and below, and I\'m talking **only** about Android for now) there are two possible cases:\r\n\r\na)\r\nthe Collection in question is one of the collections that receive a special treatment (what I used to call ""native specialization"" in the past).\r\n\r\nThese are all Collections listed here:\r\n\r\nhttp://static.javadoc.io/net.sourceforge.streamsupport/streamsupport/1.6.2/java8/util/stream/StreamSupport.html#stream-java.util.Collection-\r\n\r\nIn these cases streamsupport uses a specific Spliterator implementation for that collection that almost invariably accesses implementation details via Unsafe.\r\nThis was added (for Android) in 1.1.4-stable, the reasoning being mainly that stream splitting performance in the parallel streams case can potentially be greatly improved.\r\n\r\nThat\'s safe and exhaustively tested as long as you are on API 14 - 23.\r\nThe more you move into the future (say API >= 26) from that, the greater becomes the risk that some implementation detail in a collection has changed and my hand-rolled Spliterator implementation will fail.\r\nThat\'s the reason why I enabled Spliterator delegation by default on API >= 24. The fact that LHM behaves incorrectly in that case is unfortunate but, anyway, it\'s an Android bug and not a streamsupport bug (you\'d have the same behavior using the real Google implementation).\r\n\r\nThe reason why the LHM collection views even work on API 24/25 is that they fall under case b)\r\n\r\n\r\nb) the Collection in question is NOT one of those mentioned above.\r\n\r\nIn that case, the JRE standard IteratorSpliterator is used, i.e., the Spliterator is based on the Collection\'s Iterator.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a property that enforces the IteratorSpliterator strategy:\r\n\r\n""java8.util.Spliterators.assume.oracle.collections.impl=false""\r\n\r\nBut it **doesn\'t** work on Android (historically it did from 1.1.4-stable up to 1.3-stable).\r\nThis flag is mainly useful for non-OpenJDK, non-Android usages (for example IBM JRE 6/7, though I don\'t support them officially).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn short: In my view, the safe, ""future-proof"" way on Android is to always use the default Spliterator delegation, i.e., don\'t fiddle with the settings unless you have a real reason to do so.\r\nThe LHM bug is the only known case. But even in that case, disabling the delegation should only be a short-term workaround.\r\nBetter fix your LHM code and reenable the delegation as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThat\'s my point of view on that issue.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nStefan', 'Hi Stefan,\r\n\r\nok thanks for the clarification. I was not aware of the fact that the non-native spliterators are custom made and use reflection. I did a quick check in the source code and assumed that the original Oracle implementation is used, but you explained that this is broken on Android.\r\n\r\nConsidering this, the flag to disable the delegation is indeed not very useful anymore and it is better to include the specific warning about the use of LHM spliterators on Android 24 & 25.', 'Hi Thomas,\r\n\r\nthe ""native"" spliterators must be custom since they don\'t exist on Java 6/7 or API <= 23.\r\nThey **are** identical to the Oracle implementation, modulo the fact that they **have** to use reflection since the Oracle Spliterators also access private class internals (which they obviously can do and I can\'t do without reflection).\r\n\r\nThe IteratorSpliterator alternative has its own problems. While it works quite well in general getting the Spliterator characteristics right in all cases would be a real challenge.\r\n\r\nThe decision to remove the ""java8.util.Spliterators.assume.oracle.collections.impl=false"" flag (for Android) in 1.3.1-stable was quite intentional.\r\nIf I had maintained that flag I\'d have to test / maintain even more possible combinations than I have today.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nStefan', 'Hi Stefan,\r\n\r\nI did not realize that you need reflection to perform the same functionality but it makes perfect sense now. The problems with disabling delegation would only be made worse with the announced changes in Android P so it is not really an option anymore. Thanks for the clarification.', 'Right. Btw., the LHM bug in API 24/25 and the workaround for it is explicitly mentioned in the Android API reference.\r\nAFAIK, it was discussed only once on stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42711433/linkedhashmap-entrysets-order-not-being-preserved-in-a-stream-android\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nStefan', 'Hi Thomas  @netomi\r\n\r\nI just twiddled with a quick\'n dirty run of the streamsupport test suite on the Android P emulator.\r\nTo my surprise I did get nothing beyond those greylist warnings that you have already identified.\r\n\r\nAssuming that no further ""dark greylist"" problems turn up in the future that should be manageable.\r\nI\'ll investigate this further after my vacation.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nStefan', 'Sounds great, have a nice vacation!', ""Hi Thomas,\r\n\r\nI've only done a very superficial short test.

Apologies for reopening an old issue but it seemed an appropriate place to comment.\r\n\r\nThe reason that you no longer see the warnings about the use of internal APIs is probably because by default the early releases of P logged that information but the released version of P does not.

Change to return a long and encode the (boolean, int) flag in the long, e.g. by casting the int to long (treating it as unsigned) and then encoding the boolean as the sign, e.g. -1234 would mean that it was uncontended, and 1234 would mean that it was not uncontended.\r\n2.

The advertisement should be easy and just require a subclass to clarify its type (it would extend the base model with a type of `Map<String, String>`). The merchant one looks more complicated so I think your subclass would include another class like `MerchantData` or something. It would have fields `imageUrl: String`, `name: String`, `availability: Availability`, and `chips: Map<String, String>`. Then it would be up to your parser function to build those model objects from the `DataSnapshot`. Anything else I can clarify? 😄', ""Thanks @SUPERCILEX I actually have my generics working nicely, using the `SnapshotParser<DataSnapshot>` trick in my original question. We're looking to move a lot of our logic out of the client, and onto functions + firebaseUI lists in the clients. So out actual production models are more complex than my example there, and more will be needed as we go . I think my only remaining issue is the performance of scrolling in a recycler view with images.\r\n\r\nI can't prove 100% yet, but scrolling appears to be silky smooth when using FirebaseUI options with a single class + your nice caching SnapshotParser's **versus** using a custom SnapshotParser without the caching. Making an educated guess, I'm thinking the two `Datasnapshot.getValue(myGeneric)` being called in every `onBindViewHolder` is causing the lag. (It looks like your example doesn't cache, right?)\r\n\r\nThe single model generic seems to go all the way to the core of FirebaseUI, so I'm thinking of possibly taking @samtstern 's advice about implementing caching for multiple classes, but maybe doing it in my activity/onBindViewHolder for now. I've got datasnapshot.getKey(), so I can probably just create a new LruCache for each new model class.\r\n\r\nWould love to hear any ideas, thanks for the help!"", '@ahaverty as long as you do the intensive processing in a `SnapshotParser`, it will be cached.

I'll try to support the code I wrote and help you guys with any questions though.\n\nReading the thread it looks like the question is what the best to work on the frontend code when most of it has to be 'built' in some form. The answer is 'gulp serve'. When you run gulp serve it runs https://www.browsersync.io/ which opens your OS default browser and builds all of the static and points all requests to the running ESH instance on port 8080. I could be wrong but I believe browser sync runs on 9080, don't exactly remember. So as you make changes to static located in web-src it should push into the browser (not 100% sure on this as I don't recall the exact spot where I left off working). If it doesn't, just end the current task and start it over. \n\nWhat this allows you to do is mimic the frontend and actively develop on against it without having to rebuild/restart ESH. I would run ESH from eclipse and then use my cmd line to run the gulp serve task and would never actually hit ESH directly since all requests are proxied through to ESH.\n\nLet me know if this does not make sense or if there are any questions and again sorry for dropping off without notice!"", 'Thanks for the input @GradyD and all the best for your wife (and your kid)!\n\n@aounhaider1 As you are actively working on the Paper UI: Does this process make sense for you?

Good luck for your wife, your child and yourself.', 'Hey @GradyD, I hope your wife is better now.\nI worked on browsersync a little bit. To my understanding it helps serve pages from a specific directory. But I was stuck in an issue (maybe my understanding of browsersync is not correct) that even if we use browsersync to serve PaperUI, the links inside index.html will not resolve correctly to js/css files inside web-src files as they are set according to web folder structure. Correct me if I am wrong.', ""Hey @aounhaider1 because the gulp serve command runs a full gulp build and builds all of the UI packages and then it sends in two values. It maps, or should be, mapping everything from web-src into the web directory or vis-versa, I don't recall the specifics at this point. It does this with line 136 of the gulpfile.js by sending in the array and then up at line 123 is maps everything to the baseDir, which will override the file structure with a reverse proxy type of action.\n\nIf you are on the latest branch and run the following code. I am assuming you are at the root of the directory (coming from windows so adjust as needed) . I'm also assuming you have an active running openhab instance running on localhost:8080.\n\n```\ncd .\\extensions\\ui\\org.eclipse.smarthome.ui.paper\ngulp serve\n```\n\nIt should launch a working browsersync instance, in your OS default browser, that has the latest source from `.\\web-src`. You can test this by making an edit to a file in `.\\web-src` after you have the active openhab instance on localhost. \n\nLet me know if this is not the case"", 'It works for html files but not for js files and I think the reason behind is that in your gulp serve you are including two base directories web-src and web. And what it seems to be doing is, serving from these two directories according to their position in the array.i.e. it tries loading files first from web-src and if it does not find them it serves them from web folder. I tested that by making a change in an html file in web folder such a change is not replicated in the browser, however, if you change js file like controller.min.js (which does not exist in web-src folder) the change will be readily picked up by the browser. Note that changes made to any js controllers inside web-src will not be picked automatically by the browser. Which means that when loading a file it checks files first in web-src and then in web. \nIf you can also confirm this issue then one solution could be do to dynamically inject the js file links to index.html in web-src folder during a gulp serve, that way browsersync will always pick the correct files.', ""I haven't tested the code but from what you are saying that does sound correct. \n\nAs far as using injection, it could solve this issue.
